# Loupedeck.KeyLight.Plugin
Elgato KeyLight Plugin (unofficial) for the Loupedeck (live) interface.

Made using the [Loupedeck Plugin SDK 4](https://github.com/Loupedeck/LoupedeckPluginSdk4/wiki)

## Alternative plugin

XeroxDev also made a [plugin for KeyLights](https://help.xeroxdev.de/en/loupedeck/elgato-control/home). It's quite similar, and worth checking out. :)
